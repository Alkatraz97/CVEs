### Proof of concept (POC)
#### Reproducing Steps
Within the file upload function it is possible to choose a file that contains the desired payload instead of the name.

Once the file has been selected it will be possible to proceed by clicking the **Upload File** button.

As shown in the image below, the application performs a check on the file name and since it contains special characters it will print an error, containing the wrong file name, thus triggering our payload.

Thanks to this injection point it is possible to insert any XSS payload and collect users' session cookies, as they do not have the HttpOnly flag.
